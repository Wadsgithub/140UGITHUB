1.  You will need to save the file in the right format.  In this case .txt

  A. Windows based machines hardware repairs, upgradeability, and customization:
  I have upgraded a windows machines RAM and updated its BIOS before myself, I would have
  no idea how to do that with any other operating systems at the moment.  It was not that difficult.
  
  B. Windows OS for using creative software of any kind:
  Less compatibility issues presented themselves when I went from trying to use music production
  software on a Mac based laptop to even my very lightweight and fragile windows desktop.
  Same with the hardware components, some worked with Windows or Mac or one or the other and sometimes not at all.
  
  C. Mac OS for programming and writing python code:
  For me personally I was just able to flow a little better with the Mac book and using atom 
  or even Notebook++, that laptop has since ceased to be but
  I still appreciate the experience of being ambidextrous in any form.
  
  D. Android 10 OS for flexibility on a smart phone:
  I started out with an Iphone when I really got a decent smartphone.
  When I switched to Android, I realized that you can pretty much use the Android systems like a computer desktop in your pocket.
  The file systems are very easy to use like in Windows.
  
  E. Ios for availbility of certain exclusive apps over Android's app market:
  The app markets for android and Ios present different options to choose from and some DO NOT OVERLAP,
  although I do prefer my Android phone for doing any kind of creative work as well as posting to social media
  I do like having the option of having access to both marketplaces.

  A.  I do not use Mac for any creative work if I have the choice:
  Creative work for me personally just gets so involved that I really only use windows,
  I can not cram all the different commands and menus into my head for both windows and mac, my head would explode.
  
  B.  I will never buy a flatscreen self contained desktop again Sony Vaio Windows:
  I was first getting into music production and I did not have the time in the Army to do my research before I bought a self contained,
  touch screen desktop that was absolutly the last thing I should have bought.  8 GB of RAM will let you do close to nothing
  within Protools before it would crash.  Upgrading the RAM would have been close to pointless and would have required cracking the screen off.
  This computer and the version of Windows at the time had a ton of adware and bloatware, including some very flimsy music production software that had 
  drawn me towards the purchase.  I had an issue where an update had wiped everything out to the point where 
  I had to go back to a previous disk image multiple times. 
  
  C.  I do not like Mac hardware because of the expenses to fix or repair Macbook:
  It would be easier to just replace over repair, and getting a non-upgradeable, expensive-to-repair,
  high performance system that cannot be repaired to me sounds like a horrible idea.
  
  D.  I currently have 2 phones one IOS and one Android and it drives me nuts:
  I have found so many utilities with using an Android phone that are not available on Ios, and vice versa.
  With that being said, the switching back and forth from operating systems and physical devices gets confusing sometimes.
  I still do appreciate the usefulness of being able to operate the two different operating systems.
  
  E.  I do not like the bloatware of windows and I constantly have to sign into my microsoft account:
  With my current studio desktop I have cleared out all the extra bloatware and ad garbage because I know better
  now to just scrub that out right out of the package.  I have some issue with my account where it needs to sign in all the time in windows.
